/****************************** WHAT IS DATA BASE******************************/

-- A data base is collection of related infromation
/*Phone book
Shopping list 
To do list
Your 5 best friends 
Facebook user base

A data base can be stored in different in differnt
    On paper
    In your mind

DATA BASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (DBMS)

A special software program that helps to user create and maintain a data-base
  i. Makes it easy to manage large amounts of information 
 ii. Handles security
iii. Importing/ exporting data
 iv. Concurrency
 v.  Interact with software applications 
 
 
 Ex Amazon.com Data-Base Diagram
 -------------------              -----------------------
|  amazon.com      |   ------>   |                      |
|   As a webiste   |   <------   |      DATABASE        |
-------------------              |                      |
                                 -----------------------
Amazon.com will interact with the DBMS in order to create, read, update and delete information 

CRUD ---> Create. Read. Update. Delete.


There are two types of databases 

-------------------------------------
1. Relational databases (SQL)
-------------------------------------
Organize data into one or more tables
Each table has columns and rows 
a unique key identitfies each row

Relational Databases could be 
student as ---> Student ID---> Student name---> Students major subject
Login Info ---> Username ---> Password ---> Email

---------------------------
Relational Databases (SQL)
---------------------------
Relational databases mangement systems (RDMS)
    Help users create and maintain a relational data base
    mySQL, Oracle, postgreSQL, mariaDB,etc
Structures Ouery language(SQL)
    Stabdradr language for interacting with RDMS
    Used to perform C.R.U.D operations as well as other administrative task (user management, security, backup,etc)
    SQL code used on one RDMS is not always portable to another without modification

--------------------------------------------------------
Non-Relational DataBases (NoSQL /Not just SQL)
--------------------------------------------------------
2. Non-reational (No SQL / Not just SQL)
Organize data is anything but a traditional table
Key-Value Stores
Document (JSON,XML,etc)
Graph
Flexible tables

-----------------------------------------------
Non-Relational Database (NoSQL, / not just SQL)
-----------------------------------------------
Non-Relational Database Systems (NRDBMS)
Help users create and maintain a non-relational database
ex. Mongodb, dynamoDB, apache cassandra, firbase.

Implementation Specfic
Any non-relational databases falls under this category, so there's no set language standard
Most NRDBMS will implement their own language of performing C.R.U.D and administrative operation on the database.

----------------
DataBase Queries 
----------------
Queries are the request made to the database management system for specific information.
As the database's structure become more and more complex, it becomes more difficult to get the specific pieces of information we want.
Ex. A google search is an query.

--------- 
 WRAP UP
---------

Database is a collection of related information
Computer are great for storing data
Database management system (DBMS) make it easy to create, maintain and secure databases
DBMS allows you to create the C.R.U.D operations and other administrative tasks 
Two types of Databases, Relational and Non-relational 
Relational databases uses SQL and stores data in tables with rows and columns 
Non-relational data stores data using other data structure
Query is just the request made to the database management system
