DATA BASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (DBMS)

A special software program that helps to user create and maintain a data-base
  i. Makes it easy to manage large amounts of information 
 ii. Handles security
iii. Importing/ exporting data
 iv. Concurrency
 v.  Interact with software applications 
 
 
 Ex Amazon.com Data-Base Diagram
 -------------------              -----------------------
|  amazon.com      |   ------>   |                      |
|   As a webiste   |   <------   |      DATABASE        |
-------------------              |                      |
                                 -----------------------
Amazon.com will interact with the DBMS in order to create, read, update and delete information 

CRUD ---> Create Read Update Delete

There are two types of databases 

1. Relational databases (SQL)
Organize data into one or more tables
Each table has columns and rows 
a unique key identitfies each row

Relational Databases could be 
student as ---> Student ID---> Student name---> Students major subject
Login Info ---> Username ---> Password ---> Email

Relational Databases (SQL)

Relational databases mangement systems (RDMS)
    Help users create and maintain a relational data base
    mySQL, Oracle, postgreSQL, mariaDB,etc
Structures Ouery language(SQL)
    Stabdradr language for interacting with RDMS
    Used to perform C.R.U.D operations as well as other administrative task (user management, security, backup,etc)
    SQL code used on one RDMS is not always portable to another without modification

Non-Relational DataBases (NoSQL /Not just SQL)
    
  */

2. Non-reational (No SQL / Not just SQL)
Organize data is anything but a traditional table
Key-Value Stores
Document (JSON,XML,etc)
Graph
Flexible tables
