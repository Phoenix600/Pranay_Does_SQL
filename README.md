# SQL (Structured Query Language)

### Database

The database is a collection of related information.

A database can be stored in different mediums.

- On paper
  
- In your mind
  
- on computer
  
- In the comment section of the code editor
  
  ### Database Management Systems
  
  Special software that stores that helps users create and maintain a database.
  
  #### Two types of databases
  
  ##### Relational Databases (SQL)
  
  1. Organize data into one or more tables
    
  2. Use mySQL, Oracle, postgreSQL, mariaDB, etc
    
  3. SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
    
  4. Used to perform CRUD operations.
    

#### Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL / Not just SQL)

1. Helps users to create a non-relational database
  
2. MongoDB, dynamo DB, Apache Cassandra, firebase.
  

### Database Query

Queries are the request made to the database management system for specific information.

Ex. A google search is a query.

### Tables and Keys

The table contains rows and columns (Keys)

The column represents a single attribute

And row r the actual data entry

Every table has a primary key that will differentiate all the similar objects in the database

#### Primary Key

A primary key can be a surgent key, which has no mapping or real-world meaning to it. It can be an employee id, roll number, or serial number.

### Natural Key

A natural key is a key that has a mapping to the real world. The best ex could b password keys.

### Foreign Key

A foreign key is an attribute that we can store on a database table that will link us to another database table.

Foreign key stores the primary key of a row in another database table.

### Super Key

Key relating back to the same table database is super key.

### Composite Key

A composite key is a key that needs two attributes.
